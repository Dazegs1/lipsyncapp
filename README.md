# LipSync App (MVP)

A tiny, **free, browser-based lip-sync demo** that animates a mouth from your microphone input using the **Web Audio API**.  

## Live Usage
1. Open `index.html` locally, or
2. Host via **GitHub Pages** (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main`/`root`).

## Features
- Start/Stop mic buttons with status display.
- Mouth opens wider as voice volume increases.
- Simple loudness meter.
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no backend).

## Roadmap
- Add real mouth phoneme shapes (A, E, O, etc.).
- Add a 2D/3D avatar using SVG or Three.js.
- Support uploaded audio for lip-sync playback.
